\#Kinyarwanda using prefixes and suffixes on verb roots is some thing that troubles auto-matic translation
# or dictionary based translation, a way to recombine stuff to root can be great combined with dictionaries


children like beans
abana ba-kund-a ibishimbo
cow eat grass
inka irya ibyatsi


Is there a way to get English words classified? or infered to classes and then try to reconstruct with rules the words in Kinyarwanda?
	any Kinyarwanda linguist and english person to tell us
